# Fernanda Fahl

Hi, my name is Fernanda, I'm a cadet @42SP, a computer engeneering school focused on peer-to-peer dynamic. I'm an Architect from FAU-USP, and I'm on my way of learning how to code. I'm interested in Cybersecurity, BackEnd Dev and green technology.

Right now I'm learning how to code in C with the projects of 42SP, you can find some of them in my repositories.
